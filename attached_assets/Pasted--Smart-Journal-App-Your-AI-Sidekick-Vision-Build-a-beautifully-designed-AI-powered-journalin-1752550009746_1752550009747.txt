📓 Smart Journal App — "Your AI Sidekick"
Vision:
Build a beautifully designed, AI-powered journaling app that feels like a personal sidekick—always ready, intuitive, and deeply personalizable. Users should be able to write, draw, upload images, track moods, and revisit memories in a journal interface that’s interactive, engaging, and feels real.

🧭 Core Experience
Home/Journal Book Interface:

UI mimics an open physical journal or sketchbook. Pages flip with animation.

Modern, calming, customizable design with options for themes, covers, and colors.

Tools: Pen, pencil, marker, highlighter, eraser.

Adjustable brush size and opacity.

Full color wheel picker.

Layers for sketches/doodles over/under text.

Undo/redo.

Photo Upload & AI Analysis:

Upload or drag-and-drop photos to any page.

AI scans photos for:

Mood & Insight Tracking:

Mood selector (emoji, color scale, or slider) at start/end of each entry.

AI suggests mood based on writing/images (user can confirm or adjust).

Trends: Chart mood over time, spot patterns, highlight best/worst days.

AI offers periodic insights (e.g., “You seem happiest on weekends” or “Noticed more sad entries in February—anything you want to talk about?”).

AI Journal Assistant:

“Sidekick” persona guides and encourages.

Suggests prompts, ideas, or challenges if user is stuck (“What was the highlight of your day?”).

Reminds to write, draw, or upload if user’s streak is at risk.

🚀 User Flow Example

Sees their journal “book” on a shelf. Tap to open.

Add new entry:
Page flips to a fresh spread. User writes, draws, adds a photo. AI pops up with helpful prompts.

Mark mood & save:
User sets mood (emoji slider), saves. AI suggests tags, extracts info from images.

Calendar view:
User sees colorful dots/mood icons on calendar days. Taps to jump to a memory or edit.

Insights:
At the end of the week, the sidekick summarizes their activity and gives feedback.

🛠️ Technology Notes (For Builders)
React Native or Flutter for cross-platform mobile.

Use libraries like Fabric.js, Konva, or custom canvas for drawing tools.

Use OpenAI or Replicate for text and image AI.

Store images and files in cloud storage (e.g., Supabase, AWS S3, Vercel Blob).

Local-first approach: work offline, sync to cloud when online.

Data privacy and security are top priority.

📋 What to Ask the AI Builder
Build the above app with a focus on beauty, interactivity, and user empowerment.

Prioritize seamless performance, fun animations, and a feeling of intimacy with the journal and sidekick.

Ensure easy extensibility: let users add custom tools, brushes, stickers, etc.

Include robust onboarding to help users set up their journal their way.
