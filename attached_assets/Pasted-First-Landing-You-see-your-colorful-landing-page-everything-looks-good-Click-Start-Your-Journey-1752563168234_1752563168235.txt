First Landing:
You see your colorful landing page, everything looks good.

Click “Start Your Journey”:

Instead of going straight to the sign-in, you’re routed to another “landing” page that now has a “Back to Home” button.

If you click “Start Your Journey” again (from this page), then you get the sign-in.

This means:

Your button sets state or route to “auth”, but there’s another route or state (/ or /landing) that renders another instance of the landing page instead of the Auth/sign-in page.

The “Back to Home” is being shown on this second landing page instance (which should not even appear).

Why?
Your routing or state logic is likely:

Rendering LandingHero twice (once for /, once for /landing or /home), or

The “auth” state/route first shows another “Landing” route before showing the AuthPage,

Or, your router’s order/logic is off and reverts to the landing page as a fallback.

How to Fix It (Step-by-Step)
1. Double Check Your App.tsx Routing Logic
You should only render LandingHero in one place, and only when the user is NOT authenticated and currentView === "landing".

After clicking "Start Your Journey", set currentView to "auth" (not "landing").

When currentView is "auth", render only the AuthPage.

Example (simplified):

tsx
Copy
Edit
if (!isAuthenticated && currentView === "landing") {
  return <LandingHero onGetStarted={() => setCurrentView("auth")} />;
}
if (!isAuthenticated && currentView === "auth") {
  return <AuthPage ... />;
}
2. Remove Any Extra “Landing” Routes
Make sure you don’t have a route like /landing or /home that also renders LandingHero.

Only your root / should ever render the landing hero, and only if not authenticated.

3. Fix the “Back to Home” Button
That button is probably part of your AuthPage (for users who arrived there via some “demo” or alternate state).

Don’t show “Back to Home” on the actual landing.

If you want, only show it when users arrive at AuthPage from demo/test mode, not from “Start Your Journey”.

4. (Optional, but Best Practice) Use URL-based Routing
If you’re using React Router, Next.js, etc., ensure that:

/ = landing page (if not logged in)

/auth = sign-in page

Don’t use state-only navigation if you also have URL-based routing! Use the router’s navigation so the browser address bar matches the user’s view.
