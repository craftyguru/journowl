📅 Interactive Calendar Tab – The Heart of the App
Goal:
Create a visually engaging, ultra-functional calendar view that serves as the user’s “memory map”—where they can see, relive, and organize all their journal entries, photos, and mood history at a glance. Make this more fun and interactive than any other journaling/calendar combo app.

Key Features & UX (copy to your builder/devs):
1. Dynamic, Animated Calendar
Full calendar grid with month, week, and day view options.

Each day shows a “snippet” preview (first sentence, emoji, or image thumbnail).

Mood color coding—background or border of each date cell reflects mood selected for the day (emoji or color).

2. Entry Preview & Quick Actions
Hover or tap a date to see a popup preview of that day’s entries/photos/mood.

Click a date to open a beautiful, side-by-side, “day page” view with:

All entries for that day (writing, drawing, photos).

Mood, tags, AI notes, any achievements/unlocks for the day.

Quick tools: edit, add new, pin to favorites, share/export, print.

3. Interactive Memory Tools
Search/filter:

By mood, tags, keywords, photo content (AI-powered).

“Show all happy days,” “Show all art entries,” “Show days I traveled.”

Timeline & Streaks:

Visual streak counter for daily journaling.

See highlights—“Most active months,” “Your happiest week,” etc.

Memory Lane:

Fun animated timeline of special or pinned entries.

“On this day last year” reminders (auto-prompted by AI).

4. Entry Organization
Drag-and-drop entries:

Rearrange order within a day, move between days, or “link” entries across dates.

Tags/Categories:

Let users tag entries, group by type (Dream, Travel, Art, Mood, Note).

5. Customization & Fun
Theme picker for the calendar.

Add stickers, doodles, or custom icons to days.

Animated feedback (confetti, hearts, checkmarks) when users complete streaks, write a milestone entry, etc.

Option to “lock” private days—blurred previews, lock icon (for privacy).

6. Media & AI Integration
Photo and drawing thumbnails display right in the calendar cell.

AI auto-tags special days (“Most photos,” “Most positive entry,” “Longest streak,” etc.).

AI “Memory Suggestion” button: “Want to relive a random happy memory?”

Calendar can suggest reflection prompts (“You haven’t written much on weekends. Want to share what you do for fun?”)

What to Tell Your Builder/AI:
“Add a new tab called ‘Calendar’ or ‘Memories’ that’s the heart of the journal app. Make it a beautiful, fully interactive calendar where every day shows a visual snippet (mood, entry, or image). Let users click/hover for quick previews and open a full day’s spread—showing all writing, drawings, photos, and AI-powered insights for that day.

Users can search, filter, tag, pin, and organize entries easily. Add fun, animated features for streaks, mood tracking, and milestones. Let users add stickers or art to the calendar, and let the AI assistant pop up with helpful suggestions, memory prompts, or celebrations.

This calendar should feel like a living memory scrapbook—engaging, visual, and easy to navigate on any device.”
