Absolutely—here’s a step-by-step, developer-focused guide for your AI builder (and backend dev) to implement this system for user and admin dashboards with real-time tracking, caps, and discounted yearly plans. You can hand this directly to your dev team or use it as a spec for your own build:

1. Define the Plans in Code & Database
Plan Table/Config
ts
Copy
Edit
const plans = [
  {
    name: "Free",
    priceMonthly: 0,
    priceYearly: 0,
    storageLimitMB: 500,
    promptLimit: 100,
  },
  {
    name: "Pro",
    priceMonthly: 9.99,
    priceYearly: 99,   // 2 months free ($9.99*10)
    storageLimitMB: 5000,
    promptLimit: 500,
  },
  {
    name: "Power",
    priceMonthly: 19.99,
    priceYearly: 199,  // 2 months free
    storageLimitMB: 10000,
    promptLimit: 1000,
  }
]
Store plan name, price, yearly discount, storage, and prompt limits in your database or a config file.

2. User Usage Tracking (Backend & DB)
DB: Add Usage Fields to Users Table
sql
Copy
Edit
ALTER TABLE users
ADD COLUMN current_plan VARCHAR,
ADD COLUMN prompts_used_this_month INT DEFAULT 0,
ADD COLUMN storage_used_mb INT DEFAULT 0,
ADD COLUMN last_reset TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW();
Alternatively, store usage in a separate user_usage table if you want time-based logs.

On Every Upload/AI Action:
Check limits before accepting:

If prompts_used_this_month >= current_plan.promptLimit, block or prompt to upgrade/top up.

If storage_used_mb + new_upload_size > current_plan.storageLimitMB, block or prompt to upgrade/delete.

Increment counters after successful action.

3. Scheduled Monthly Reset Job
Run a serverless scheduled function/cron on the 1st of each month:

Reset prompts_used_this_month to 0 for all users.

Optionally, reset or archive old data.

4. User Dashboard Display
Show current plan (name, features, and upgrade link)

Display usage bars/meters:

"You’ve used 35 / 100 AI prompts this month"

"You’ve uploaded 200 / 500 MB this month"

Progress bars and color warnings (green/yellow/red) as limits are approached.

Upgrade/renew/discount yearly call-to-action button

UI Example
jsx
Copy
Edit
<ProgressBar value={promptsUsed} max={plan.promptLimit} label="AI Prompts Used" />
<ProgressBar value={storageUsed} max={plan.storageLimitMB} label="Storage Used (MB)" />
<Button>Upgrade Plan</Button>
<Button>Save 2 Months: Go Yearly</Button>
Can be animated, colorful, and include tooltips with more info.

5. Admin Dashboard Display
List of all users, sortable by plan

Display for each user:

Plan name

Prompts used (this month)

Storage used (MB)

Warnings for users at/near their cap

Option to export/download usage stats

Admin Table Example
User	Plan	Prompts Used	Storage Used	Status
user@email	Free	99/100	400/500 MB	Near Limit
pro@email	Pro	150/500	2,200/5,000	OK
power@email	Power	200/1000	4,900/10,000	OK

6. Real-Time Updates
Use WebSockets or real-time DB listeners (e.g. Supabase's real-time, Firebase, or Pusher) to update both user and admin dashboards immediately as actions happen.

Users see usage meters update live after every upload or prompt.

Admin sees changes instantly for monitoring/troubleshooting.

7. Discounted Yearly Purchase
On the plan selection page, display both monthly and yearly prices ("Save 2 months with yearly!").

At checkout, handle billing accordingly (Stripe, Paddle, etc.).

8. Notify Users Approaching Limits
Send in-app alerts (toast/notification) and emails when users reach 80%, 90%, and 100% of any limit.

Link directly to the upgrade/plan page.

Summary for Your AI Builder
