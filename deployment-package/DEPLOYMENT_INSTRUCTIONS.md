## Important Notes

### Digital Asset Links (Critical)
- The `assetlinks.json` file MUST be uploaded to your website
- This enables deep linking and makes the app open your website seamlessly
- Verify the file is accessible before submitting to Google Play

### Keystore Security
- Keep `journowl-release-key.jks` safe and backed up
- You'll need this same keystore for all future updates
- Passwords: store=`journowl2024`, key=`journowl2024`

### App Updates
- TWA apps automatically reflect website updates
- Only need Play Store updates for version bumps or new TWA features
- Users see changes immediately when you update your website

## Troubleshooting

### Build Issues
- Ensure Android SDK is properly installed
- Check that keystore passwords are correct
- Verify Digital Asset Links are properly configured

### Store Rejection
- Most common issue: Digital Asset Links not properly configured
- Ensure all required metadata is complete
- Screenshots must show actual app functionality

## Support
If you need help with the deployment process, the generated Android project follows standard TWA patterns and can be built with any standard Android development environment.
