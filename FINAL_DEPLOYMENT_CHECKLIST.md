**CRITICAL**: Before building your AAB, verify the keystore fingerprint matches Google Play Console:

1. **Check Play Console Expected Key**:
   - Go to Release > Setup > App integrity
   - Find "Upload key certificate" 
   - Compare SHA-1 with: `40:2D:C9:41:8F:C7:CF:70:03:7E:51:E5:D5:8D:1E:18:A0:0B:6F:E3`

2. **If they match**: ✅ Use our keystore
3. **If they don't match**: Use Google's expected keystore or update console

```

5. Credentials: store=journowl2024, key=journowl-key, pass=journowl2024
```

**Option B - PWABuilder.com (Easiest)**:
```
