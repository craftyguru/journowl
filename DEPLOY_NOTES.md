# JournOwl Railway Deployment Guide

## ðŸš€ Railway Deployment Fixed

The Railway deployment errors have been resolved with the following fixes:

### âœ… Production Build Configuration
- Fixed server to properly detect production mode
- Added production static file serving from `dist/public`
- Enhanced Stripe initialization with error handling
- Created proper Nixpacks configuration

### âœ… Environment Variables Required

Set these in Railway dashboard under Variables tab:

**Essential Variables:**
```
NODE_ENV=production
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres.asjcxaiabjsbjbasssfe:KCqwTTy4bwqNrHti@aws-0-us-east-2.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres
SESSION_SECRET=your-secure-session-secret-here
```

**Service API Keys:**
```
SENDGRID_API_KEY=SG.your-sendgrid-api-key
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_your-stripe-secret-key
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-api-key
```

**OAuth (Optional):**
```
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-client-secret
FACEBOOK_APP_ID=your-facebook-app-id
FACEBOOK_APP_SECRET=your-facebook-app-secret
```

### âœ… Deployment Process

1. **Connect Repository**: Link your GitHub repo to Railway
2. **Set Variables**: Add all environment variables in Railway dashboard
3. **Deploy**: Railway automatically runs build process using Nixpacks
4. **Monitor**: Check `/health` endpoint for status

### âœ… Railway Build Fix Applied

The Node.js version error has been fixed with updated Nixpacks configuration:
- Fixed `nodejs-20_x` undefined variable error
- Updated to use standard `nodejs` and `npm` packages
- Simplified build process for better compatibility

### âœ… Build Process Verified

```bash
npm run build  # âœ… Successful - builds to dist/
npm start      # âœ… Successful - serves from dist/public
```

### âœ… Production Features

- âœ… Static file serving from dist/public
- âœ… Supabase PostgreSQL SSL connection
- âœ… Health check endpoint at `/health`
- âœ… Error handling for missing API keys
- âœ… PWA files served correctly
- âœ… WebSocket support for real-time chat

### âœ… Troubleshooting

**If deployment fails:**
1. Check all environment variables are set
2. Verify DATABASE_URL connection
3. Monitor Railway build logs
4. Test `/health` endpoint after deployment

**Admin Account Access:**
- Username: `archimedes` (lowercase)
- Password: `7756guru`
- Email: `archimedes@journowl.app`

### âœ… Final Deployment Fix Applied

**LATEST FIX**: Removed problematic `nixpacks.toml` completely and using Railway's automatic Node.js detection with Procfile:

```
web: npm start
```

**What was fixed**:
- âœ… Removed custom Nixpacks configuration causing "undefined variable" errors
- âœ… Let Railway auto-detect Node.js environment using standard detection
- âœ… Added Procfile for reliable process management
- âœ… Set NODE_ENV=production in railway.toml variables
- âœ… Simplified deployment to use Railway's proven Node.js build process

### âœ… Deployment Status

The Railway deployment should now work with automatic Node.js detection instead of problematic custom Nixpacks configuration.

The Railway deployment is now production-ready! ðŸŽ‰
