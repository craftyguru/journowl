# IMMEDIATE FIX: Google Play Console Signing Error

## The Problem You're Seeing
Google Play Console error: **"Your Android App bundle is signed with the wrong key"**

## The Solution (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Upload Our Certificate to Google Play Console
1. **Go to**: Google Play Console > Release > Setup > **App integrity**
2. **Look for**: "Upload key certificate" section
3. **Click**: "Upload new certificate" or "Use a certificate" 
4. **Upload this file**: `deployment-package/journowl-upload-cert.pem` (I just created it)

### Step 2: Enable Google Play App Signing
1. **In the same section**: Check "Use Google-generated key" or "Enable Google Play App Signing"
2. **This allows**: Google to manage the final signing while accepting your upload certificate

### Step 3: Re-upload Your AAB
1. **Go back to**: Release > Testing > Open testing (or Production)
2. **Delete** the rejected AAB if it's still there
3. **Upload** the same AAB file again - it should now be accepted

## What This Does
- **Tells Google**: "This is my official upload certificate"
- **Allows Google**: To re-sign your app with their own keys for security
- **Enables TWA**: Digital Asset Links will work properly
- **Future updates**: Use the same keystore for all future uploads

## Alternative: Download Google's Certificate
If the above doesn't work, Google may have already generated an upload certificate:

1. **In App integrity section**: Look for "Download upload certificate"
2. **Download** the `.pem` file Google provides
3. **Convert to keystore**:
```bash
keytool -import -alias google-upload -file downloaded-cert.pem -keystore google-keystore.jks
```
4. **Re-sign AAB** with this new keystore
5. **Upload** the newly signed AAB

## Files Ready for Upload
- **Certificate**: `deployment-package/journowl-upload-cert.pem` ← Upload this to Play Console
- **Keystore**: `deployment-package/journowl-release-key.jks` ← Keep using this for future builds
- **AAB**: Use the same AAB you tried to upload (just re-upload it after certificate setup)

## Expected Result
After uploading the certificate to Google Play Console, your existing AAB should be accepted without needing to rebuild anything.

This is a standard first-time app setup process - very common and easily fixed!
