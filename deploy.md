# 🚀 JournOwl Deployment Guide

## Step-by-Step Deployment to GitHub and Railway

### 1. 📦 Prepare Your Project

Your project is now ready for deployment with the following files created:

✅ `railway.toml` - Railway configuration
✅ `.env.example` - Environment variables template  
✅ `README.md` - Complete project documentation
✅ `LICENSE` - MIT license
✅ `.gitignore` - Updated with production files

### 2. 🐙 Push to GitHub

```bash
# Initialize git repository (if not already done)
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit your changes
git commit -m "Initial commit: JournOwl AI-powered journaling platform"

# Add your GitHub repository as origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/journowl.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. 🚂 Deploy to Railway

#### Option A: Connect via Railway Dashboard
1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Click "Deploy from GitHub repo"
3. Connect your GitHub account
4. Select your `journowl` repository
5. Railway will auto-detect the Node.js project

#### Option B: Use Railway CLI
```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login to Railway
railway login

# Initialize project
railway init

# Deploy
railway up
```

### 4. 🔧 Configure Environment Variables in Railway

Set these variables in Railway dashboard:

**Required:**
```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://... (Railway provides this automatically)
SESSION_SECRET=your-super-secure-random-string-here
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-api-key-here
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=5000
```

**Email (Recommended):**
```
SENDGRID_API_KEY=SG.your-sendgrid-api-key-here
FROM_EMAIL=noreply@journowl.com
```

**Optional (for payments):**
```
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_your-stripe-secret-key
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_your-stripe-publishable-key
```

### 5. 🗄️ Set Up Database

After deployment, run database setup:

```bash
# Option 1: Via Railway CLI
railway run npm run db:push

# Option 2: Via Railway dashboard terminal
npm run db:push
```

### 6. 🎯 Post-Deployment Steps

1. **Test the application**
